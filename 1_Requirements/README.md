Sensor

A sensor is a transducer whose reason for existing is to sense (that is, to recognize)
some normal for its environs. It identifies occasions or changes in amounts and
gives a relating yield, for the most part as an electrical or optical sign; for instance,
a thermocouple changes over temperature to a yield voltage. Be that as it may, a
mercury-in-glass thermometer is likewise a sensor; it changes over the deliberate
temperature into extension and constriction of a fluid which can be perused on a
balanced glass tube.
For ex. Thermocouple which is a temperature sensor , it detects temperature and
gives output in voltage. Similarly different type of sensor are available which
that detects events or changes in quantities and provides a corresponding output,
generally as an electrical or optical signal.

Flex sensor

Flex sensor are the sensor that changes in resistance depending on the amount of
bend on the sensor .They convert the change in bend to electrical resistance .The
more the bend the more the resistance value .They are usually in the form of a thin
strip from 1’’ to 5’’ long that very in resistance . A basic Flex Sensor is 2.2" long. As
the sensor is flexed, the resistance over the sensor increments. The resistance of
the flex sensor changes when the metal cushions are on the outside of the twist (
message on within curve ). Connector is 0.1" dispersed and bread board neighborly.
The estimation of the yield relies on upon the twisting of the sensor subsequently,
the yield we get is a simple quality also, this yield can be send to ADC IC or of
Controller.

ATMEGA328

The superior Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller consolidates 32KB
ISP flash memory with read-while-compose capacities, 1KB EEPROM, 2KB
SRAM, 23 universally useful I/O lines, 32 broadly useful working registers,
three adaptable timer with analyze modes, inner and outer interrupts, serial
programmable USART, a byte-arranged 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port,
6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8-diverts in TQFP and QFN/MLF bundles),
programmable guard dog timer with interior oscillator, and five product
selectable power sparing modes. The gadget works between 1.8-5.5 volts.
