ABSTRACT

In this high-tech world everybody need privacy and security to maintain it. Many
type of sensor and controller are used to designing security system . This paper
presents that to detect the status of the door by using a flex sensor, which is used
for home application purpose. Flex sensor response when it gets bend , its
resistance change according to the amount of bending on it. At straight position it’s
give nominal resistance value and at 90 degree position it’s give highest resistance
value. Apart from this flex sensor can be used for making of gaming gloves , robotics
etc. here it connected with a voltage divide circuit which output voltage is vary
according to the bending of the sensor. The output of the voltage connected with
Arduino kit. Arduino is hardware and software based platform for seeming well
and good and control a greater amount of the physical world than your desktop PC.
It's an open-source physical processing stage in view of a basic microcontroller
board, and an advancement domain for composing programming for the board .
The analog output voltage of the circuit get converted into digital form .
Corresponding to the digital value a code is to be written in the Arduino software .
we can check the status of the door in the software and also in the Arduino board by the indication of LED.
